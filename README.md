Fitts' law Simulation.

Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the targetâ€™s size, the longer it takes.

Here, the experiment consists of a circular multi directional clicking application.

Input Modality Considered: Mouse.

A 2D pointing task is created with 16 targets. These 16 targets are placed in a circular form following the ISO 9241-9:2000 standards.

To run the program: Download the HTML and JS file and run in the HTML file in the local browser.
